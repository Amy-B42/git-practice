                <h4>Get ready for your brain to feel sparkly!</h4>
                <p>Our brains LOVE to learn new things, think of this journey as feeding that love. But love isn't always easy, is it? </p>

                <p>The best advice I can give is to keep going, don't stop. Keep going, don't stop. Keep going don't stop! 
                   There is so much support available; needing and asking for help is just as much a part of the process as 
                   breaking through and conquering a brand new language. </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
